## Domain Slices

Playing with Scala 3 typeclass derivation to provide automatic "one-way" conversions between types

### Usage

This is very experimental, most likely not going to be flushed out into its own library (because there are already similiar solutions like chimney)
Fighting with compiler bugs, etc.

This is a normal sbt project, you can compile code with `sbt compile` and run it
with `sbt run`, `sbt console` will start a Dotty REPL.
